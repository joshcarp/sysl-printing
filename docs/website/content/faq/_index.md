## Is Sysl the right tool for me?
Sysl (pronounced "sizzle") provides an improvement over many current system design and architecture practices.
If you are struggling to keep all of your design, implementation and testing work in sync, then the answer may be yes.

Sysl can create diagrams, data schemas, code (Java, JS) and data transformation.
The set of outputs is open-ended and allows for your own extensions.

## I found a bug! What do I do?
To report a bug, please use our [Issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/joshcarp/sysl-printing/issues/new/choose).

Or, to be a hero, you can fork Sysl, fix the bug yourself and create a pull request to fix it for everyone. Please have a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/joshcarp/sysl-printing/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Where can I talk in more depth?
You could drop us a line at [hello@sysl.io](mailto:hello@sysl.io).
